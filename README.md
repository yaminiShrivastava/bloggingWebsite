Developed a dynamic, secure MERN stack blogging platform with user-friendly features, including JWT-based login, logout, and post creation.
Designed and constructed a website for writing and sharing blog posts. I used technologies like MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN) to create the site from scratch.

Login Page

Focused on user security by implementing a system called bcryptjs, which safeguards user passwords. I also added JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for login and logout, ensuring that only authorized users can access the website.

Improved the user experience by making it easy for people to read the blogs. I also added a feature that lets users create their own blog posts, making the website an interactive and welcoming place for people to share their thoughts.Only authorised user can create new post
